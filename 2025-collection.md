# TIL6022 Python Programming – Group Project Repositories (2025 Q1)

This page collects the GitHub repositories from the **TIL6022 Python Programming** group projects.  
Each repository contains the code, documentation, and other materials produced by the student teams.

This year the group topics consist of open ended topics chosen by students and fixed topics focusing on the SAIL Amsterdam 2025 crowd management use case. The SAIL Amsterdam 2025 use case is part of the [AIM-TT project](https://aimtt.nl/) supported by Dr. Winnie Daamen. For some teams, the conceptual design for the SAIL dashboard projects is jointly conducted through the [TIL Research & Design Methods](https://www.tudelft.nl/studenten/faculteiten/citg-studentenportal/onderwijs/master/transport-infrastructure-logistics/programme-2025-2026/1-fundamentals/til-research-and-design-methods-2-1) course supported by Dr. Arjan van Binsbergen.

## Group 19

**Project Research Objectives:** 
Quantify whether disruption frequency and duration are higher during peak hours compared to off-peak, controlling for calendar events and planned works. Identify routes and corridors where peak-hour vulnerability is most acute, with emphasis on high-throughput hubs such as Amsterdam Centraal, Utrecht Centraal, Rotterdam Centraal and Den Haag Centraal. Characterize whether disruption causes differ by time-of-day and assess their peak-hour severity profiles. Forecast disruption counts per hour for increased passenger flow in the future based on realistic data on expected NS users and forecasting models widely used in academia.

## Group 20

**Project Research Objectives:** 
To develop an interactive dashboard that aids effective crowd flow management for the SAIL2025 event in Amsterdam. First and foremost is (i) governance, to make sure the dashboard can be safely used in a work setting. Then we are dealing with (ii) representation, to make it easy to understand complex, quickly changing data. And last but not least is (iii) prediction, to use the available datasets to guess how crowd flow will change.
